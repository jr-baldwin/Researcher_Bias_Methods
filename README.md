# Data_Scrambling_Tutorial

This is a tutorial for data scrambling in R. 

Data scrambling is a way to blind your data in order to trial and refine analyses before pre-registering a study. 

Data scrambling was originally proposed by MacCoun and Perlmutter (2017); for more information, please see their [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119095910.ch15?saml_referrer) for a detailed description and simulated examples.
